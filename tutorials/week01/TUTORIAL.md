Week 1 Tutorial Questions
=========================

We examine
* functions
* structs
* vectors


Ex01 - Functions 
---------
* Create a function that accepts a double value as a parameter and
* Returns a bool value if the double is greater than zero and the square value instead of initial passed value.

Question:
* What is a function signature?

Ex02 - Functions 
---------
* Create an additional function that accepts a double value as a parameter and
* Returns bool value if the double is greater than zero, the square value of the initially passed value, and the passed value incremented by one

Question:
* Could we hypotetically call this function the same name as the existing function created in Ex01?

Ex03 - Struct
------
* Create a structure called `Sensor` than contains
* A variable for the number of samples `num_samples`
* An array of samples `double data[]`
* Create a sensor from the struct
* Populate data with 5 elements, each data[i] =i. How to code end of loop?
* Create a function that prints samples 
* Can you initialise a sensor of two elements in one line of code?

Questions:
* What is the problem with using an array here?
* What are the issues with using a struct? (Enter concept of Classes)
  
Ex04 - Vector
------
* Create a vector of integers called  `data` of length 10 elements 
* Create a loop to populate elements of `data` (each element [i] =i))
* Loop to print elements of vector


Questions:
* How to create a vector of floats?
* How could we pass the length to the executable instead of hard coding 10?


Ex05 - Vector of Vectors (Container of Data)
------
* Create a vector of vectors containing integers called  `data` 
* Create a loop to populate elements of `data` such that is is a matrix of 4x4 elements (each element row =i))
* Loop to print elements of `data`

Questions:
* What else could you store in this container?
