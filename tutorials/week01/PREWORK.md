Week 1 Pre-work
=========================

Please complete refresher of pointers, arrays and loops/type-casting.

Ex01 - Pointers & Reference
--------------------

Work on [pointers.cpp](./starter/pointers.cpp)

* Assign to variable x (of type double) the value 41012
* Use a pointer ip to point to x (why type is ip?)
* Print the value of what ip is pointing to
* Print the value of ip
* Make variable y a reference to x (what type is y?)
* Print the value of what y is referencing to
* Create a variable z (of type double) the value 1
* Use pointer ip to point to z
* Make y a reference to z (is this possible?)
* Assign y the value of z
* Assign z the value 100
* Print the value of what ip is pointing to
* Print the value of x 
* Print the value of y 

Ex02 - C Arrays
--------

Work on [arrays.cpp](./starter/arrays.cpp)

* Create an array x of doubles with 10 elements
* Initialise the elements of the array on creation, each element [i] has value i
* Create a loop to populate elements of x (each x[i] =i), how to code end of loop?)
* Can you use a pointer and loop to initialise elements of array

BONUS: Loops - Typecasting
-------------------

Work on [loops_typecasting.cpp](./starter/loops_typecasting.cpp)

* Create an string array `char[] x` to value `41012`
* Can we typecast to integer each value Add up all the elements (as numbers)?
* Count number of elements less than 2 using a for loop
* Use a while loop / range-based for loop
