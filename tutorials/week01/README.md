First and foremost, the subject is delevred on Linux, so we discuss Linux, CMake as the build system, and QTCreator as Integrated Development Environment.

Attempting pre-work enables students to partake in class. To understand a concept you will need to reflect on it, you will need to have been introduced to it to reflect on the concept. Therefore, seeing a concept for the very first time in class will not be effective. 

Pre-work is refresher of concepts you have covered thus far in your course: pointers, arrays and loops.

In the tutorial we will cover other essentials concepts that you have covered thus far in your course: functions and structs. All of these are basics of C and will be used in C++. 

We introduce one concept from C++, that we will use extensively, Standard Template Library (STL) vectors.
