Week 3 Tutorial Questions
=========================
Work through these questions to understand what is going on in each example. If you have any questions about the material please raise them in the next tutorial session.

Inheritance - Ex01
--------------------

This question is consolidated from Quiz1. Examine your implementation of [quiz1](../../quizzes/quiz1/b) as the starter.

Refer to base class `Shape` and implement:

* Circle as a derived class of Shape
* Implement the getArea method in Circle

Consider: Which members (data/methods) should belong to base class and whcih to derived class.

* Implement `setCentre` 
* Define and implement `offsetCentre` methods.

Consider: Where should this function be placed (both the declaration and implementation)?


Inheritance - Ex02
------------------

Building upon your previous solution.

* Write a program that accepets a point *(x,y location)* and displays if a shape intersects that point (to intersect means the point is within the area of the shape)?

Consider: Where should this function be placed (both the declaration and implementation)?

  
Inheritance - Ex03
------------------

Building upon your previous solution.

* Create a Rectangle and Triangle, can we store both of them in one vector?
* After solving previous point, write a program that accepets a point *(x,y location)* and displays all shapes that intersect that point (the point is within the area of the shape)?

Consider: What will be the type for this vector? Are there any issues with completing item 2 here?
